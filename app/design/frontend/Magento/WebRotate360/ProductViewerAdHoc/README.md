 ```shell
 /pub/static/frontend/Magento/your-root-theme-folder-path/WebRotate360_ProductViewerAdHoc/360assets/sampleshoe/config.xml
 ```


## Create your own views

Download [WebRotate 360 Product Viewer software](http://www.webrotate360.com/products/webrotate-360-product-viewer.aspx) (SpotEditor) and publish a 360 or a multi-row 3D product view using your images. You may use our sample images located under additional resources in the previous link.

FTP upload is available inside the software or you may upload everything manually via FileZilla or a similar client. You only need to upload a single folder located under published/360_assets of your published SpotEditor project for each product view. You may also publish multiple product views into a single 'published' location on your hard-drive and upload all product views at once.

Note the URL of the configuration file (.xml) in the uploaded folder and enter a relative URL of the configuration file on your server in the new attribute field (webrotate_path) for selected products in the Catalog.


## CDN and 'master config' (PRO)

You can create an extra product attribute with the attribute code set to webrotate_root to allow specifying an alternative location of the images for each product. The root value is a URL (e.g http://mycdn.com/360_assets/product1/) that can point to a folder with images on an external server. When it's configured, the module will prepend the webrotate_root URL to the relative image path stored in the viewer configuration xml for each image. This is valuable when you need to host the assets on a dedicated file server or CDN.

This feature can be also used to load multiple product views via a single 'master' config xml that you can set under the plugin settings via Master Config URL. If Master Config URL is configured in the module settings, you donâ€™t need to specify the webrotate_path attribute in the catalog for the products that share the same config , i.e you would only use the webrotate_root parameter, pointing to the image assets. Note that this will work as long a the number of images and their file names are the same across selected product views.
